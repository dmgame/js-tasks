# js-tasks

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list like so: (index1, index2).

Call examples
``js
twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]
``
